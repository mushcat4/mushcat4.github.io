    <p class="lead" id="widePara">Firstly, there are two deadlines every year: the first in <strong class="fw-medium ">October</strong> and the other in <strong class="fw-medium">March</strong>. You have two opportunities to become a Gilman recipient, so donâ€™t give up! I recommend extensively using the Gilman site for more details on the prompts and what to mention in your essays. I also used this helpful <a href="https://suabroad.syr.edu/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Gilman-Writing-Tips-Fall-2019.pdf" target="_blank">Gilman Essay Outline</a> to help structure my essays.<br> <br> The essay that you should dedicate the most time to is without a doubt the <strong class="fw-medium ">Statement of Purpose Essay</strong>. This is where the reviewers truly get to know you and your <strong class="fw-medium">motivations</strong> for studying abroad. When showing how you overcame a challenging experience, use examples that are unique to you. Emphasize the impact it had on you and how it contributed to your <strong class="fw-medium">personal growth</strong> rather than the event itself. Find ways to highlight the qualities that can <strong class="fw-medium">connect</strong> you to your desired study abroad program. <br> <br> Working closely with your campus <strong class="fw-medium">study abroad</strong> or <strong class="fw-medium">scholarship office</strong> can help resolve questions you might have about the application process and how to write your essays. I also highly recommend utilizing a <strong class="fw-medium">writing center</strong> to go over and revise your essays before submitting them. I know that these essays are daunting, but if you give yourself enough time to work on them I know you will have an amazing time studying abroad! </p>
