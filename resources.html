      <h2>Statement of Purpose Essay</h2>
      <p>As a kid, I hated growing up in our quiet border town in South Texas, sleeping on the floor toe-to-toe with my parents and sisters. But at least I was never alone. With my family by my side, I was resilient and applied myself in school, leading the way to college for my sisters. Seeing how far I’ve come as a first-generation Latino student in computer science, I am so grateful for my upbringing, family, and diverse background. My experiences helped make me a more well-rounded individual and I know that I will be able to draw on them to enhance my study abroad in Japan.

        Unfortunately, in the midst of the Pandemic, it seemed near impossible to be the first one in my family to complete their degree, let alone study abroad. In the beginning, I thought I might even like online learning since I’m more introverted but being that isolated for so long proved to be too much. I quickly got burnt out from constantly pushing myself and I started feeling the pressure of my family's expectations; so, I froze and gave up. As my grades suffered, I lost my drive and debated if graduating was even possible. At my lowest, however, I recalled the nights my parents would break down, saying that they wished they had graduated for us. I understood that I couldn’t let all my hard work go to waste– their lifetime of hard work. I decided to be patient with myself and prioritize my mental wellbeing, so I only took one class. If I could handle it, then I would give college another chance. It hasn’t been easy, but I learned a lot and now I am back to being a full-time student.
